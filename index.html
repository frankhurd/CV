      <h1>Frank Hurd</h1>
      <p><em>Coastal Fisheries Project Director</em> at <strong><a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/">The Nature Conservancy</a></strong></p>
      <p>Frank‚Äôs passion for developing solutions that benefit both nature and people arises from a true love for the outdoors and wanting to share it with anyone who is up for the adventure. Born and raised in California, Frank has spent much of his life exploring the vast natural treasures that California has to offer, from its drastic peaks of the Sierra Nevada, to the impressive river systems, to its lush kelp forests and everywhere in between. Frank found a way to give back by pursuing a career in ocean science and conservation, originally as a research SCUBA diver with a Bachelors of Science in Aquatic Biology from the University of California Santa Barbara. Frank then attended the Bren School at the University of California Santa Barbara where he earned a Masters in Environmental Science and Management with a specialization in Economics and Policy of the Environment as well as a certificate in Management Practice from UCSBs Technology Management Program. He put this new collection of skills to use in designing, building, and operating an experimental offshore aquaculture farm in the Gulf of California in an effort to produce sustainable seafood and generate replicable business models for local fishing communities.
    Frank joined The Nature Conservancy in 2016 and leads on various aspects of our California coastal fisheries project and is primarily focused on closing the information gap in fisheries management through harvester science and application of new technologies. Over the last three years he has worked with fishermen, other non-profits, government staff, academics, and software developers to pilot cost-effective data collection tools and programs that inform highly adaptive fisheries management. This work began with a demonstration project in the California Red Abalone fishery where he led an effort to develop a new technology application that allows divers to submit abalone images from phone or tablet based web browsers which then automatically calculates abalone length using image recognition technology. Those images and data are then stored and shared for use in deciding how to manage the abalone population. Frank now seeks to improve and scale that technology to benefit fisheries here in California and across the globe.
    In his spare time, you are most likely to find Frank in a body of water <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWjZt-S3B54">freediving</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_aXrxyoiVE">surfing</a>, open water swimming, whitewater packrafting, harvesting, SCUBA diving, kayaking, sailing, or kitesurfing.
